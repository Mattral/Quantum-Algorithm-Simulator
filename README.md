## 📚 How to Use the Simulator

### 🔰 For Complete Beginners

**Start Here:** If you've never heard of quantum computing, don't worry! Follow this path:

1. **Read the Welcome Guide**: Look for the blue information boxes at the top
2. **Try Your First Gate**: Drag the purple `H` (Hadamard) gate onto the circuit
3. **Watch the Magic**: See how the Bloch sphere changes - that's superposition!
4. **Click the ? Buttons**: Every element has helpful explanations

### 🎮 Basic Usage

#### Building Your First Quantum Circuit

1. **Choose a Gate**: From the colorful gate palette, click and drag a gate
2. **Place on Circuit**: Drop it onto the circuit grid (the table-like structure)
3. **Observe Changes**: Watch the Bloch spheres and probability charts update
4. **Experiment**: Try different combinations and see what happens!

#### Understanding the Interface

- **Gate Palette**: Collection of quantum gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T, CNOT)
- **Circuit Grid**: Visual representation of your quantum algorithm
- **Qubit Controls**: Add or remove qubits (quantum bits)

**Center Panel - Visualizations**

### 🎓 Learning Path for Students

#### Level 1: Single Qubits
1. Start with just one qubit
2. Try the `X` gate (quantum NOT) - see it flip from |0⟩ to |1⟩
3. Use the `H` gate (Hadamard) - create superposition!
4. Experiment with `Y` and `Z` gates

#### Level 2: Superposition
1. Apply `H` gate to see superposition in action
2. Understand probability distributions
3. Learn about measurement collapse

#### Level 3: Multiple Qubits
1. Add a second qubit
2. Try gates on different qubits
3. See how qubits can be independent

#### Level 4: Entanglement
1. Use `H` on first qubit, then `CNOT` between qubits
2. Observe how qubits become "connected"
3. This is the "spooky action at a distance" Einstein talked about!

## 🧠 Quantum Concepts Explained

### What is a Qubit?
Think of a regular computer bit like a coin lying flat - it's either heads (0) or tails (1). A qubit is like a spinning coin - it can be heads, tails, or spinning (both at once)!

### Key Quantum Phenomena

**🌪️ Superposition**
- A qubit can be in multiple states simultaneously
- Like Schrödinger's cat being both alive and dead
- Created using the Hadamard (H) gate

**🔗 Entanglement**
- Multiple qubits become mysteriously connected
- Measuring one instantly affects the other
- Created using CNOT gates after superposition

**📏 Measurement**
- Forces quantum systems to "choose" a definite state
- Results are genuinely random (not just unpredictable)
- Destroys superposition and entanglement

## 🎮 Interactive Features

### Quantum Gates Available

| Gate | Color | Purpose | Best For Learning |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**The 3D spheres aren't loading**
- Ensure WebGL is enabled in your browser
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for error messages

**Gates aren't responding to drag and drop**
- Make sure you're dragging from the gate palette
- Try clicking and holding before dragging
- On mobile, use touch and hold

**Probability charts show all zeros**
- This is normal for the initial |000⟩ state
- Add some gates to see probability changes
- Try the H gate first for immediate results
